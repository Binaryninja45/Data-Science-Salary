# Data-Science-Salary
# Project Overview
This repository contains a Notebook detailing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of data science salaries. The analysis focuses on various factors influencing data science roles' salaries, including experience level, job title, employee residence, and more, using a dataset of 3,755 entries.

# Key Features
* Data Exploration: Understanding the structure and distribution of the dataset, including missing values, data types, and summary statistics.
* Data Visualization: Utilizing seaborn and matplotlib for visual analysis of the salary distribution, employment types, and job titles.
* Correlation Analysis: Investigating the relationship between different variables like work year, salary, experience level, and remote ratio.
* Statistical Insights: Gaining insights into trends in the data science job market over recent years.

# Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas for data manipulation
* Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
* Jupyter Notebook
  
# How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook (Data_Sci_Salary.ipynb) to view the analysis.

# Data
The dataset used (ds_salaries.csv) contains multiple attributes including work year, experience level, employment type, job title, salary, and more. The dataset has 3,755 rows and 11 columns, with a mix of integer and object data types.

# Observations & Conclusions
The dataset provided valuable insights into the data science job market from 2020 to 2023.
A significant increase in data science roles was observed after 2020.
There's a positive relationship between work years and salary in USD, albeit not a strong one.
The majority of the data science roles are full-time, with the United States being the predominant location of both employees and companies.
Senior-level employees (SE) generally receive the highest salaries.
